    Development is a lone-term journey, and it's important to keep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following articles are some of the things I've learned and want to
    record.
  </p>
  <p>So that I can review them whenever I need them.</p>
  <p>
    For the reason, the categories of the articles are not only following the
    ragular structure but containing some of particular things that I need to
    record as a reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
  </p>
  <p>I'm looking forward to receiving your feedback.</p>
